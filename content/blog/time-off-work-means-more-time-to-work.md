Enter [Boomerang.link](https://boomerang.link)

The goal of the app is relatively simple: as I find articles, videos, and tweets that I enjoy/find useful, I want to save them for later. But the regular bookmarks feature built into browsers is not enough for me. They are practically a black hole to links. Never to be seen again. And that's the problem.

**Problem #1:**

Once you bookmark a link, it just sits there. Most people just build up a "collection" of bookmarks and do nothing with them. Never revisit them again. It is hard to learn information if you only ever see it/read it once.

I am especially bad about this. As I browse the internet, I often find loads of great articles (or even [tweets](https://twitter.com/Shpigford/status/1437553757651415043)) full of great words. Things I want to learn. Things that I want to embody. Things I want to remember. Most of the time I am not in the right mindset for that particular nugget of information. Sometimes I know it will be more applicable to me later down the road (like when growing/scaling a SaaS).

**Solution #1:**

I should be able to save a link for later, but make the link remind me about itself later. Resurfacing the ideas or content I read once before. Brining them back into the forefront of my brain. Like a boomerang. I can throw it out into the universe, and eventually it will come back to me.

"Solve your own problems." That's what they say. So why not?

## The time crunch

As my 2 weeks of vacation were approaching, I knew this would be a bit of a challenge for me. I have started and stopped many projects. I wanted this to be different. Knowing my own brain, I needed some extra help. I needed more accountability.

So I decided to create a call to action. I posted on Indie Hackers starting this project as a [2 week SaaS challenge](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/2-week-saas-challenge-f7007e66d0). Inviting others to join me. Helping to keep me accountable and maybe even give them the motivation they needed to make progress on their project.

Strong turnout? Nope. Crickets. I did not get a **single** person who wanted to join me. Or at least enough people to see the post and want to join me. But that's alright.

I want to build in public more. Here is another chance. Sharing as I go.

Time to get to work.
