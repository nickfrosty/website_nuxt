Even though it's only been a few days into the year, literally 2, I have been very productive. After all, 2022 did start off with a weekend and my weekends are usually the best time for me to get stuff done. Plus this is my last days before I go back to my day job after a 2 week holiday ðŸ˜¢. So I was extra motivated.

## This week

My big focus has been in migrating my older projects to my new server. I had upscaled the server a while back to have more storage for log.fm, but since I plan on going a different hosting route for it later, I no longer need the larger server. Sadly, digital ocean does not support scaling down the disk space :/ 

### Maker:
- wrote/published 1 full article, and drafted another
- recorded 5 1/2 videos for my YT channel
- created a notion doc to help track my daily progress
- started the stripe integration for my first product

### Manager:
- began migrating projects from my old server, to my new one
- signed up for email octopus for my building in public newsletter I want to grow
- made several social comments on twitter and IH (got some nice page views to Boomerang and my site)
- update the renewal settings on the MANY domains I have and don't use


While doing this migration, I was able to record the the devops videos on setting up the new server. So win, win I guess. These 5 videos I was able to record puts me at 8 total to edit, for my 12 video goal for the year. So maybe I need to expand my video goal for the year?

With this server migration, and updating the domain renewals, I am trying to cut costs where I don't need to spend!

## Next week goals/tasks

I think my day job will be light this week, but my kid is staying home from day care too, so it will be interesting to see how much time I can actually manage to get good maker time. Usually I can get more of the manger/marketing things during that "interruptible" time

### Maker:
- complete the stripe integration
- publish the MySQL article in progress
- finalize my new YT endtro

### Manager:
- complete the server migration
- schedule 4 tweets
- test the Vercel platform
- minor research on AWS

Shoutout to [@ryanstrickler](https://twitter.com/ryanstrickler) for the "schedule some tweets" idea. He mentioned it as part of his plan in our mini-mastermind.

> PS: Here is [my personal notion doc](https://shard-piper-911.notion.site/2022-Get-things-done-df66e4729bd84b68bfaf16e74b7b4b51) that I am recording my daily progress for 2022.
