With a local web server installed on your Windows or Linux computer, you can start creating and practicing your programming. 

Your local web server should at a minimum:

- install php (for back end coding)
- install MySQL databases
- include phpMyAdmin (to help manage your MySQL databases)
- include the SendMail application to send local emails

For every single one of my local web server that I have setup over the past 10 years, I always use the XAMPP suite. By default, XAMPP comes with more than enough for even the most skilled web developers to create their own websites.

## How to Setup a Local Web Server

1. Download the XAMPP server software from ApacheFriends.org
2.  Install XAMPP (to the default location)
3.  Start the Apache and MySQL applications
4.  Allow Apache and MySQL though the firewall
5.  Browse to your local web server

## Step 1: Download the XAMPP server

Like I said before, I always use XAMPP for my local web servers. It is a free open source software suite created by the good people at ApacheFriends.org. So browse over to their website [here](https://apachefriends.org) to download the latest version of XAMPP.

![Setup a local web server - Install XAMPP - 1 download XAMPP server](/media/articles/php/install-php-on-windows/Setup-a-local-web-server-Install-XAMPP-1-download-XAMPP-server-1024x640.png)

One of the many reasons I love to use XAMPP for my localhost server, is that is is cross platform. Meaning you can install XAMPP on Linux or install XAMPP on Windows. And as a user of both, I am grateful for that! 

***Please note:*** This tutorial will go through the steps to setup a local web server and install XAMPP on Windows. But the process is mostly the same.

## Step 2: Install XAMPP server

With your XAMPP installer downloaded, you are ready to open that sucker up and start installing the XAMPP server software. With XAMPP, you will be able to install all of the web server applications you need to operate your server and websites.

> ***Please note:*** You will need administrator permission on Windows in order to install XAMPP on Windows. If you do not already have admin permission, you will need to contact your administrator.

Go ahead and launch the XAMPP server installer, and accept the UAC message for admin permissions.

You will get a message from the XAMPP installer reminding you that you **must **install XAMPP with admin permissions. If not, then you will not have a fully functional local web server. Bummer!

### Select the XAMPP components

On the second screen of the Windows server installer, you will be given the options for which server applications you want to install. Each one has a different purpose:

- PHP and Perl (used for web dev programming)
- Apache (this runs the HTTP server)
- MySQL and phpMyAdmin (to create and manage your databases)
- SendMail (to send email from your local server)
- FileZilla (for FTP access to your local server)

At a minimum, I would install Apache, MySQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin, and SendMail.

![Setup a local web server - Install XAMPP - 2. select XAMPP modules to install for XAMPP server](/media/articles/php/install-php-on-windows/Setup-a-local-web-server-Install-XAMPP-2.-select-XAMPP-modules-1024x874.png)

Honestly, I recommend installing all of the server programs that XAMPP give you the option for. They don't take up a lot of space, and you can always learn about them later.

After you select all the server programs to install, move onto the next screen.

### Choose your server installation folder

Next, you will be given a choice of where your local web server will be installed in Windows. By default, your XAMPP server will be installed to:

```bash
C:\xampp
```

I recommend installing your local server to the default location. There is really no reason to change it.

### Complete the XAMPP server installation

Next, you must choose your desired written language for your web server.  

Now with all your server programs selected and your installation directory chosen, you can click through the rest of the XAMPP installer to complete the installation.

## Step 3: Start the Apache and MySQL applications

Once the XAMPP installation has completed, you are ready to open up the XAMPP control panel. The control panel will be your go to spot to start and stop the web server "services" (aka programs).

You can open the XAMPP control panel any time from the Windows start menu. Or if you already had the program open and minimized it, then check your "more" section of your taskbar. 

![Setup a local web server - Install XAMPP - 3 xampp control panel to open Apache and MySQL](/media/articles/php/install-php-on-windows/Setup-a-local-web-server-Install-XAMPP-3-xampp-control-panel-1024x665.png)

From inside the control panel, you will see options for to start each of your local server's applications, or "services". Each service is basically just an application that will run in the background of Windows.

Each time you want to start your local XAMPP server, you simply need to click the *Start *button for the Apache and MySQL services.

## Step 4: Allow Apache and MySQL though the firewall

The **first **time you start each of the XAMPP services, you will get a Windows firewall popup. This is totally normal so do not be alarmed. This is simply the web server programs requesting access to the internet.

![Setup a local web server - Install XAMPP - 4 - xampp installer Windows firewall security popup to allow Apache and MySQL though the firewall](/media/articles/php/install-php-on-windows/Setup-a-local-web-server-Install-XAMPP-4-xampp-installer-Windows-firewall-security-popup-1024x751.png)

Each of the firewall popups must be correctly acknowledged. Be sure to check the "Private networks" options at a minimum. This will allow the other computers on your private local network to access your XAMPP web server.

Additionally, you can also select the "Public networks" option if you want other people on public networks like airports and coffee shops to have access to your XAMPP server. I do **NOT** recommend this option. But live your best life.

## Step 5: Browse to your local web server

After Apache and MySQL have been granted access though your firewall, you are just about ready to browse to your local web server.

From the XAMPP control panel, you should see a green status for both Apache and MySQL. If you do not, then you can simply Stop then Start each of the web server services. Sometimes, the first time you start each server the do not get a green status because of the Windows firewall. This is completely normal.

![Setup a local web server - Install XAMPP - 5. xampp control panel with Apache and MySQL running](/media/articles/php/install-php-on-windows/Setup-a-local-web-server-Install-XAMPP-5.-xampp-control-panel-runnin-1024x670.png)

Once you have green status for both Apache and MySQL, you can open your web browser and navigate to your web server address:

```
http://localhost
```

Alternatively, you can press the Admin button next to Apache in the XAMPP control panel.

Now your local web server is all setup and ready to go!

## What to do with your local web server?

![Setup a local web server - Install XAMPP - 5.1 open your localhost web server for the first time](/media/articles/php/install-php-on-windows/Setup-a-local-web-server-Install-XAMPP-5.1-open-your-localhost-web-server-for-the-first-time-1024x629.png)

With your local XAMPP server all setup and ready to go, you are fully ready to embark on your web dev dreams. Start coding out all those sweet websites you have been dreaming of!

> I STRONGLY recommend adding some extra security to your local server by [changing your MySQL root password](/articles/change-mysql-password-from-command-line).
