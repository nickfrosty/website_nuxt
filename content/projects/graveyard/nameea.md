## The goal

As an amateur domain collector/investor, I began to amass a sizable collection of domain names. Once I decided to downsize my "portfolio", I wanted to sell some.

## The result

Successfully sold 2 domain names from this self created platform.

## What's next?

This project/site is no longer available.

The domain has expired and now this is the landing page for that project.
