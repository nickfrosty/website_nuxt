## The problem

For several months after Twitter released *Spaces*, their live audio chatroom product, there was no way to search for them. 

Either active ones or scheduled.

## The goal

Spacebird was created to bridge the gap of what Twitter was seemingly slow to roll out: a way to search and find specific topic based Twitter Spaces.

## Tech stack

- Vue.js - frontend framework
- TailwindCSS - CSS tooling and designing
- Elasticsearch - as a scalable search database to cache the Twitter API calls (to prevent reaching the very low rate limit)
- Node/Express API - RESTful API to communicate between the Twitter API and the Elasticsearch database

## What's next?

This project/repo is no longer maintained and has been open sourced.

After Twitter released their public Spaces search, directly in the app/website, Spacebird was shutdown. In early 2022, the original domain, Spacebird.io, was sold at auction. 

I have made the [git repo public](https://github.com/nickfrosty/spacebird) and can be used by anyone.
