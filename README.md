## Build Setup

This website is written with NuxtJS using TailwindCSS. 

It is meant to be built and maintained as a static website. (SSG for you cool kids out there)

If you don't know, you can run these 3 commands on this repo to build the site locally:

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn dev

# generate static project
yarn generate
```
